This is an implementation of [Keyboards and Covert Channels](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec06/tech/shah/shah.pdf) using a kernel-based
software keylogger.

Currently not designed to be deployed outside of my own machine, but I will eventually provide instructions on how to recreate the demo environment.
